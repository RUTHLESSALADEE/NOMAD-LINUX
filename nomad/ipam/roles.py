"""What each subnet is for, its role: a VLAN's subnet, a point-to-point link, loopbacks, a tunnel, a routed port's
subnet, a container (a block holding other subnets), or other (its purpose isn't known yet). Not every subnet is in
a VLAN, so the VLANs and Subnet Placement pages only expect VLAN things of VLAN subnets, and the placement checks
know a tunnel's or a point-to-point link's ends are one place, however far apart they are on the map.

A role is worked out (detect) from what the network map shows (the interfaces with addresses in it: a tunnel or
loopback interface, an SVI or subinterface, a routed port plugged into a switch's access VLAN, the two ends of a
link), then from IPAM (a loopback subnet, a /32, a /30 or /31, subnets inside it, a name such as Vlan 6) and the
VLANs page (linked to a VLAN). Anyone can set it instead (SubnetRole, kept beside the placements in the IPAM
database, never on the subnet), Other included.
