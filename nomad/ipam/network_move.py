"""Moving a subnet from one IPAM network to another: once the addressing is imported, a plan changes and a block turns
out to belong to another network (another enclave's page, say).

The subnet goes with its recorded addresses, and (if asked) the subnets inside it with theirs. What's said about it
beside IPAM goes too: its role and how it's treated (Subnet Placement). Its VLAN links belong to the old network's
VLAN domains, so they're dropped, and it can be linked to a VLAN of the new network's instead. It's refused while
the new network has anything in the way (a subnet overlapping it, or an address recorded in it) or a placement move
of it is under way.

plan() says what would happen; move() does it within one database (this computer's, or the server's for the tribe:
one change, all or nothing). From this computer to the tribe, payload() is sent for the server to receive() and
then remove() takes it from here. In the old network it shows as deleted, and in the new one as made (history).
