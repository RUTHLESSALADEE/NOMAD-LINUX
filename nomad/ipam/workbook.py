"""Writing networks out as pages of an addressing workbook, laid out like the tribe's (so the spreadsheet can be kept
up to date from IPAM, and imports back as it went out).

Each network becomes a page:
    a header row (the enclave or "Network Name", Telephony Rng, Subnet, Mask, Gateway, Reserved, Assignment, then any
    other subnet details),
    the unit row: unit | location | revision date | revision,
    the summary, a row per subnet,
    "Unit Base Info" with the network's other details,
    "Detailed Info": each subnet again, address by address (every address, for subnets up to 256; otherwise the
    recorded ones), with Y under Reserved and the name under Assignment,
    "End".
The layout has no place for an address's MAC or description (the CSV export has them). A used address with no name
is written as "In use", since the importer skips rows with neither a Y nor a name.
