"""This computer's copy of the tribe's maps, and the changes made here that the server hasn't got yet.

The copy keeps each map as the server last had it (base) plus this computer's changes not sent yet (pending, the
latest of each item). A map is read as base with pending on top, so it opens and changes offline; sync() sends the
pending changes, then fetches everyone else's, which land in base under any pending change to the same item (the
pending one is sent afterwards, so it wins: the last change made to an item is the one kept).

Each map's SNMP credentials (its secrets) are kept on the server too, encrypted, so everyone in the tribe crawls and
watches it with the same ones. The copy keeps them (encrypted for this Windows account, or this computer in the
service) for offline use, fetches them again whenever the server says the map changed, and holds a change made
offline until it can be sent, like the map's own changes.

Thread-safe: the map page syncs on a worker thread while it reads and saves on the UI thread, and the Map Watcher
service uses it from its own.
