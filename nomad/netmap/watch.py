"""Watching a map for devices and hosts added to the network, and putting them on it.

Every few minutes each switch read over SNMP is asked for its CDP and LLDP neighbors (a couple of short columns, not
the whole crawl). When a switch's neighbors change from what they were, or a syslog message or trap says something
happened on it, the map is crawled again from that switch, the way Crawl from Here does: new neighbors are read and
added, and the hosts on its ports and its VLANs are refreshed (VLANs added, gone or renamed, ports moved to
another VLAN, and subnets that appear, go or move between devices are noted in the watch log). Every so often every switch is read like that, to catch hosts
plugged in where nothing announced it. What turns up is added to the map straight away and noted in its news, so it's
drawn as new until someone looks at it.

Qt-free: NOMAD's map page and the Map Watcher service both use it. Reading runs on a worker thread; what changes the
map (apply_refresh) runs wherever the map is owned.
