# Keyboard guide

Press **F1** in NOMAD to open the searchable guide. Search by key, action or tool name; **Ctrl+F** focuses the guide's search box. Collapse a workflow group to shorten the list.

## A quick workflow

1. **Ctrl+K** — choose a tool.
2. **Alt+A** — select the network adapter, if needed.
3. **Ctrl+F** — jump to the tool's main input or filter.
4. **Shift+Enter** — start a diagnostic/discovery tool.
5. **Shift+Esc** — stop a running tool. Packet Capture stops and saves.

**Ctrl+Tab** changes tools; **Alt+Left / Alt+Right** changes sessions within Terminal or SCP. **Ctrl+Shift+Enter** moves a session between the main window and a pop-out.

## Important scope changes

- **Shift+Enter / Shift+Esc** run and stop only supported tool pages. Search fields on Network Map and Network Reset, multiline editors, and remote terminals retain their existing key behavior.
- **Ctrl+W** closes the active Terminal/SCP session. NOMAD asks before disconnecting, with **Yes** selected so **Enter** confirms; SCP also keeps its warnings for transfers and unsaved edits. This replaces the remote shell's Ctrl+W word-deletion behavior.
- **Alt+Left / Alt+Right** switches sessions on Terminal/SCP. In SCP file lists, folder-back has moved from Alt+Left to **Alt+Up**. **Backspace** still goes up one folder.
- **Ctrl+S** starts (or stops) a terminal session log and **Ctrl+Shift+S** saves the running config, like the buttons below the session. Ctrl+S no longer reaches the remote host as XOFF (output freeze).
- **Ctrl+L** focuses the path only inside an SCP file pane. Terminal Ctrl+L continues to go to the remote shell.
- **Alt+A** leaves focus mode to reveal the adapter picker.
- Shortcuts use the same enabled actions as buttons. They do not repeat while a key is held.

Shift+Enter starts these tools: Ping, Traceroute, Sweep, Ports, MTU, Latency, iperf, SNMP Walk, DNS Lookup, DNS Servers, Web Check, Packet Capture, DHCP Servers, Switch Port, MAC Finder (Locate Now; Enter in its search box is Find). Stop is available where the tool has a Stop button; DNS Lookup and Web Check do not have cancellation actions.
